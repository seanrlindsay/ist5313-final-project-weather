Winter storms are known as the “silent killer” of severe weather. Compare the sound of falling snow and dropping temperatures to the roar of a tornado or crack of a lightning bolt. Winter storms may be quiet, but they are no less deadly. Some winter storms are known as “white-outs” because they are so dense with blowing snow that visibility is nearly zero. In a white out, people outdoors can easily become disoriented, get lost, and freeze to death. 
 Blizzards with dangerously low temperatures, freezing rain, sleet, icing, and strong winds can easily paralyze a whole city. The iced-over or snow-blocked roads, knocked-out power and communication can last for a few hours or many days. The icy walkways cause injuries from falls while the icy roads cause injuries from car wrecks. High snow banks against doors can trap people in their homes or cars.  If heavy snow, ice or high winds knock down power lines or cause trees to do so, people without electricity to power their heaters may be forced to use alternate sources of heat, since prolonged exposure to low temperatures can result in hypothermia and frostbite. If they use inappropriate sources of heat indoors, the possibility of death due to carbon monoxide poisoning and/or fires is greatly increased. 
Prepare for winter storms by storing supplies and your emergency kit early. Stay informed of the weather forecast and plan to stay indoors wearing warm clothing during the storm. Have a safe indoor alternative heat source in case of a power outage. Avoid driving during a storm, but if it’s absolutely necessary, tell others of your route, arrival and departure times. If stranded outside, seek shelter and make a signal that rescuers can see near your shelter. Replace wet clothing with dry clothes immediately. Wear a hat and mittens instead of gloves, if possible. Check for frostbite and/or hypothermia frequently. If frostbite is present, warm but do not rub the affected area, and seek medical help as soon as possible. Hypothermia is a life threatening condition in which the body’s core temperature drops below 95o F. Immediate medical attention is crucial for survival.
