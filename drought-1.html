Extreme heat is a form of severe weather that can affect almost all parts of the United States. When a Heat Wave blankets the northwestern states, temperatures can rise above 100 F for several days. The combination of high heat and humidity for an extended period can be the cause of a life threatening event known as a Heat Stroke. During a Heat Stroke, the body’s temperature control system stops working and the body overheats. Heat Stroke can be fatal if not quickly reversed.  The high humidity of a Heat Wave contributes to this system failure by preventing sweat from evaporating into the humid, saturated air. Water, which is sweat’s main ingredient, absorbs excess heat from the body and carries it away when the sweat evaporates. To avoid Heat Stroke during a Heat Wave, it is very important to keep the body’s core temperature from rising, since sweating will not be effective in lowering it back to normal. Be careful to avoid exertion and consistently drink water during high temperatures. Avoid consuming salt, caffeine, and alcohol which increase dehydration. Remember to stay out of direct sunlight and wear light-colored, breathable clothing when outdoors. 
Across the southwestern U.S., an Excessive Heat Warning is a familiar event. This means daytime highs of 105o F to 110o F are expected for at least 2 days. Although the temperature is high, the lack of humidity in the air makes sweat evaporation possible, cooling occurs, and so the heat is bearable. Unfortunately, the higher temperatures create a higher than usual demand for indoor air-conditioned cooling which can cause a power shortage or outage. To prevent this from happening, insulate your home and windows, use fans, and set the thermostat no lower than 780 F.
The arid climate encourages the evaporation of water, but very little is returned in the form of rain.  This long period of low rainfall can last for years and is known as a Drought. Droughts produce many dangers, such as crop damage, wildfires from dry foliage, and dust storms from windy areas with bare soil, but the most obvious is the depletion of the water supply for both humans and animals. Both animals and humans use water to cool the body. Without enough water, the chance of heat stroke or death by dehydration increases greatly. Remember to provide sufficient shade and water for your animals and don’t ever leave them in a parked car. Always conserve water and reuse it whenever possible.				<!--- include your transcript here --->
