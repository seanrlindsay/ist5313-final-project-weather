					The fastest and most lethal form of severe weather is the tornado. With wind speeds up to 300 mph, even small objects that are picked up become deadly projectiles once airborne. In fact, flying debris is the cause of most deaths during a tornado. They are formed as a funnel-shaped cloud extending down from a thunderstorm and appear without warning, which makes them particularly deadly. Their forward speed averages 30 mph, but can be as fast as 70 mph. These roaring winds produce a sound similar to a freight train and the path of their destruction can be as much as a mile wide. When these funnel-shaped clouds form over water, they are known as waterspouts.
A tornado’s strong winds can lift up, turn over, and throw objects through the air that are not properly anchored, such as vehicles and mobile homes. Never stay in a mobile home or mobile office during a tornado watch. If you’re indoors when a tornado is near, stay inside only if the building is permanent and get to the lowest, inner-most room under a sturdy table. If outside, move to the lowest possible place such as a ditch, not under an overpass, and cover with a blanket or cushiony material. In a car, drive to the lowest place possible, but stop driving if debris starts to hit the car. Park the car, put on the seat belt, get down, and cover with a blanket or cushiony material. It is urgent that you take cover as soon as possible!
