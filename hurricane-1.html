				One of the most damaging forms of severe weather is the hurricane.  These ferocious storms have winds speeds from 75 mph to as much as 200 mph and develop over the ocean. Warm equatorial water evaporates with rising warm air which forms a huge circular wind pattern several miles in diameter.  Well-formed hurricanes have an area of completely calm weather in their center known as the “eye” of the storm.
The strong winds of a hurricane cause great damage through deadly flying debris and blown down trees and power lines.  Since flying objects and trees can crash through glass windows, stay away from those that are not boarded up. As the hurricane moves ashore, the strong winds push ocean water inland. This is known as the “storm surge” and is the cause of devastating flooding.  Flood waters trap people in homes and buildings for days and cover roads, making rescue attempts very difficult. Dangerous situations can also result when animals, such as snakes, are swept into people’s homes by the flood waters.  Downed power lines, which may have electrified the water, can be hidden under the water’s surface, providing another reason not to walk through flooded areas. If flooding is eminent in your home, turn off the electricity and natural gas.
Areas not directly affected by flooding may still have power outages and contaminated tap water. Prepare for a power outage by freezing water in several large clean plastic bags to keep the food in the refrigerator and freezer cold. Don’t open the door when the power is off. Once melted, the bags may be used for drinking water. As a last resort, use an eyedropper and chlorine bleach to add a few drops to the tap water when your stored drinking water is depleted. 
Long before the storm arrives and before grocery store shelves are depleted, buy and store enough drinking water for every person to have one gallon per day for at least 3 days. In addition, canned food, a can opener, batteries, flashlights, a first aid kit, and a battery powered radio are all needed in your emergency kit. Consider buying a generator and solar cell phone charger also. Fill up your car’s gas tank and evacuate as soon as possible if officials say to do so.				<!--- include your transcript here --->
