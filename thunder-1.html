The most commonly experienced severe weather in the U.S. are thunderstorms and lightning.
These dramatic events can produce torrential rain lasting from one half to one full hour. The 
deluge of rain overwhelms common water channels and the resulting flash floods kills more 
than 140 Americans each year. Avoid camping or parking along creeks and rivers which can 
flood quickly in heavy rains. Don’t walk or drive through flood water. Flowing water six inches 
deep can push you down while flowing water two feet deep can move your car. 
 In addition to the rain, the lightning in a thunderstorm is just as deadly. Lightning kills an 
average of 51 Americans per year and causes debilitating injuries to hundreds more. While the 
chance of being struck by lightning is fairly low, 1 in 600,000 per year, learning to avoid an 
episode with lightning is definitely worthwhile.
Lightning is nature’s way of evening out the electric charges in various areas. A bolt of lightning 
is the movement of those charges between the storm cloud and the ground or from one part of 
the cloud to another. Thunder is the sound made as the lightning bolt super heats the air 
around it, so that it expands and contracts quickly, like a hand clap. “Heat lightning” is the term 
for lightning in a storm too far away to hear the thunder. Objects that are good conductors of 
electricity offer an attractive path for lightning. Since water is an excellent conductor, never 
stay in a body of water when lightning is seen anywhere in the sky, even if there is no rain. 
Lightning may strike as much as 10 miles away from the rain. In fact, lightning from “dry 
thunderstorms” is a common cause of wildfires in the western U.S.  Avoid tall objects, such as 
trees, which are more likely to be struck as they shorten the distance between the cloud and 
the ground, creating an attractive path. The human body is also an attractive path as it consists 
mostly of water. Rubber-soled shoes do not conduct electricity, but will not protect you. The 
lightning will move from the top of your body down to your ankles and simply jump to the 
ground. The same thing happens with rubber car tires, so stay inside a car when lightning is 
near, but don’t touch the outer metal frame where the electricity will travel. 
In addition to the lighting, thunderstorms can also produce other dangers such as strong winds, 
hail, and even tornadoes.  In general, the safest place to be during a thunderstorm is indoors, 
but stay away from the plumbing!					<!--- include your transcript here --->
